/**
 *   Each sub-section of "Plugins" should have a title which specifies a plugin filename.
 * Filenames have a wildcard of *.  Appending .smx is not required.
 * If the filename has no explicit path, it will be patched to any sub-path in the plugins folder.
 *
 *   Available properties for plugins are:
 * "pause"			- Whether or not the plugin should load paused - "yes" or "no" (default)
 * "lifetime"		- Lifetime of the plugin.  Options:
 * "mapsync"	 	- Plugins should be reloaded on mapchange if changed (default)
 * "global"	 		- Plugin will never be unloaded or updated
 * "blockload" 		- Plugin will always be blocked from loading.  Implicit (automatic) loads 
 *					  produce no error, but explicit (manual) loads will show an error message.
 *					  (Options are one of "yes" or "no")
 *
 * You can also have an "Options" section declaring options to pass onto the JIT:
 * "profile"	- Bit flags for profiling level.  Add flags together to reach a value.
 *				  WARNING: Profiler is _ALPHA_ software!  Use it at your own risk for 
 *				  development cycles only (not production setups).
 *				  See the wiki article "SourceMod Profiler" for more information.
 *				  1 - Profile natives
 *				  2 - Profile callbacks
